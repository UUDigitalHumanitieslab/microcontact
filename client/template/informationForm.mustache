			<h1>PARTICIPANT INFORMATION FORM</h1>
			<p class=lead>Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study. This form details the purpose of this study, a description of the involvement required and your rights as a participant.</p>
			<p><strong>Information and Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this study is to understand what happens when two languages get in contact. We aim to do this by collecting and studying language data of first-generation Italian immigrants who moved to North or South America between the 1940s and the 1960s, and those of their descendants (heritage languages). You can participate in this research if you are an Italian immigrant to America (North or South), or if you belong to a family of immigrants.</p>
			<p><strong>Your Participation:</strong> Your participation in this study will consist in the following.</p>
			<section>
				<p><u>First stage of the research:</u></p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you were born in Italy or in America and speak one of the following:
						<ul class=list-inline>
							<li>Venetan,</li>
							<li>Piedmontese,</li>
							<li>Neapolitan/Campano,</li>
							<li>Abruzzese,</li>
							<li>Palermitan/Sicilian,</li>
							<li>Salentino,</li>
							<li>Florentine or</li>
							<li>Senese</li>
						</ul>
						ask somebody who knows how to use internet to record you and upload your recording on <a href="https://microcontact.hum.uu.nl/#contributions" target=_blank>the interactive atlas</a>.
						If you know how to do this yourself, you can certainly do it.</li>
					<li>Please record max 10 minutes (or even shorter), in which you tell the story of when you arrived in America, or about something that happened when you were young.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>After the recording has taken place, the audio file can be uploaded on an interactive atlas, where it will be hearable by anyone interested. Your name will never be made public.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p><u>Second stage of the research:</u></p>
				<p>If your language is selected for a second stage, you will be contacted by a researcher, who will come to your town to interview you. The interview will last no more than 1 hour, and will only concern your language.</p>
				<p>Participation in this research is voluntary and free. There is no penalty for discontinuing participation, you can decide not to participate in all stages, and you can withdraw at any time. </p>
				<p><strong>Benefits and Risks:</strong> The benefit of your participation is to contribute information for linguistic analysis, for understanding how languages work when they are in contact with other languages. You will also offer very important documentation of your language, which will be of use for anybody working on the culture and history of Italian emigrants.<br>
				There are no risks associated with participating in the study. You will never be asked any money or any material contribution, in any form, at any stage of the research. You will only be helping science.</p>
				<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Your name will not be recorded and will never appear publicly. Your name and identifying information will not be associated with any part of the written report of the research. All of your information and interview responses will be kept confidential.  The researcher will not share your individual responses with anyone other than the research team.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions, concerns or complaints, please contact Prof. Roberta D’Alessandro (see below).</p>
